I've worked on atmospheric remote sensing &mdash; especially cloud and precipitation radar &mdash; since about 2008 and have recently started working on applications of machine learning to these problems. I hope this blog will help others put these methods into practice.

I'm working with the [Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lte/) at the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/).
